**QGIS 101**

### Panes of interest:

* "Layers"
* "Browser"
* "Processing Toolbar"

### Recommended plugin: **"QuickMapServices"**

*This is amazing!* Just turns bg layers.

For me on first install: really subtle 3x globe icons on far RHS of 2nd toolbar down

Default: OSM and NASA

Add more: "QuickMapServices" / "Settings" / "More services"
-> click through red "Attention!"

Dozens new background maps!

### **"Layers"**

* "groups"
	* eg: all regions
* (eye drop-down): "themes"
	* eg: all roads

Allow multiple ways to chop things up.

#### Layer **"Attributes"**

Range of selection tools around with yellow boxes.

"Show only features .." drop down at the bottom is cool (beware if you forget it's on and then freak out all your features are missing).

"Select features using an expression"
"Fields and Values" -> "fclass"

* "All Unique"
* "10 Samples"

#### **Layer visuals**

"Styles"

"View" -> "Preview Mode" -> (all the colour blindesses)

"Properties"

"Symbology":

Note things like opacity and markers. Many options here. Need to press "Apply".

Discussion about how different organisations create styles sets for themselves. Apparently very painstaking someone has to go through once. But then can use that as a template henceforth (missed name of template file).

"Symbology": dropdown
* "Rule-based" -- can make every 2nd topo line 

"Symbology": for layer type "DEM" Digital Elevation Model (DEM) type Layer there are many ways of rendering them. This is very good. 

* Contour lines
* Gradient hills
* Hillshade -- for shading hills, knob to choose angle of Azimuth 

Many other options.
